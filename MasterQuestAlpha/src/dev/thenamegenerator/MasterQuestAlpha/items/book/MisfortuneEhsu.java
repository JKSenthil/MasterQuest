His grandmother had given up hope, and was awaiting the day she would lift from the world to the stars. There was little to no interaction between Ehsu and his grandmother, and Ehsu was free to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. He was thoroughly bored during the day, and it was his boredom that would lead him cherishing the art of trickery." + 

			"One day, he decided to venture into the jungle that encompassed Isurium. Ehsu had loitered for sometime before an idea struck him. There were recent sightings of tigers in the vicinity, so he hollered “TIGER” to see what would happen. Suddenly, a rush of town people ran in and saw Ehsu tricking them. Ehsu laughed, and the townsfolk walked away, all thinking what was wrong with Eshu. Ehsu found it quite amusing." +

			"And so he continued to cry out everyday until the townsfolk knew that it was a prank. After a week, no one checked up Ehsu. They all knew that he was tricking them for his own amusement." +

			"Then one day, Ehsu decided to pull of the prank again. Right as he was about to yell, a tiger popped out of the bushes and was right in front of Eshu. Terrified and with all of his might, Ehsu yelled “TIGER!”. Unfortunately, the townsfolk dismissed it as a prank, and poor Eshu was eaten by the tiger." +
